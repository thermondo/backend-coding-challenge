Generic single-database configuration.

How to add a new table to the database:

1. Create table (should be an instance of `AbanosTable`)
2. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"`
3. The autogenerated migration has to be adjusted if custom fields are used.
    Accordingly, import statements might require changes.
4. Run `alembic upgrade head`
