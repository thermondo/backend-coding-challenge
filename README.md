# Backend Senior Coding Challenge 🍿

Welcome to our Movie Rating System Coding Challenge! We appreciate you taking
the time to participate and submit a coding challenge! 🥳

In this challenge, you'll be tasked with designing and implementing a robust
backend system that handles user interactions and provides movie ratings. We
don't want to check coding conventions only; **we want to see your approach
to systems design!**

**⚠️ As a tech-agnostic engineering team, we ask you to pick the technologies
you are most comfortable with and those that will showcase your strongest
performance. 💪**

## 🗒️ Running the solution:

To run the solution:

- go to the root folder:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

## ✅ Requirements

- [✅] The backend should expose RESTful endpoints to handle user input and
  return movie ratings.
- [✅] The system should store data in a database. You can use any existing
  dataset or API to populate the initial database.
- [✅] Implement user endpoints to create and view user information.
- [✅] Implement movie endpoints to create and view movie information.
- [✅] Implement a rating system to rate the entertainment value of a movie.
- [✅] Implement a basic profile where users can view their rated movies.
- [✅] Include unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
- [✅] Ensure proper error handling and validation of user inputs.

## ✨ Bonus Points

- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for users.
- [✅] Provide documentation for your API endpoints using tools like Swagger.
- [✅] Implement logging to record errors and debug information.
- [✅] Implement caching mechanisms to improve the rating system's performance.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD quality gates.

## 📋 Evaluation Criteria

- **Systems Design:** We want to see your ability to design a flexible and
  extendable system. Apply design patterns and software engineering concepts.
- **Code quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best
  practices.
- **Functionality:** Does the system meet the requirements? Does it provide
  movie
  ratings?
- **Testing:** Adequate test coverage and thoroughness of testing.
- **Documentation:** Clear documentation for setup, usage, and API endpoints.

## 📐 Submission Guidelines

- Fork this GitHub repository.
- Commit your code regularly with meaningful commit messages.
- Include/Update the README.md file explaining how to set up and run your
  backend, including any dependencies.
- Submit the link to your repository.

## 🗒️ Notes

- You are encouraged to use third-party libraries or frameworks to expedite
  development but be prepared to justify your choices.
- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on the
  requirements.
- Remember to approach the challenge as you would a real-world project, focusing
  on scalability, performance, and reliability.

## 🗒️ TODO

- Apply the logging guidelines to all the services as already applied in (Auth Service).
- Add all unit tests for all the services as already applied in (Auth Service).
- Update the Apis Documentation for all services to have more information about the data transfer
  objects and more information about the errors.
- Apply caching to more endpoints like Get All Movies.
- Add Access levels to the user like admin (Authorization)
- Add prehook command to add check linting rules and all tests are passed before committing
- update CI/CD pipelines to checking for the tests (coverage and passed) + required approvals
- Add helm for k8s deployment.
- Add api gateway service

## 🤔 What if I don't finish?

Part of the exercise is to see what you prioritize first when you have a limited
amount of time. For any unfinished tasks, please do add `TODO` comments to
your code with a short explanation. You will be given an opportunity later to go
into more detail and explain how you would go about finishing those tasks.
